Description: iNEXT.beta3D features non-asymptotic analyses for taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional diversity based on Hill numbers family: It computes the estimated diversities for standardized samples with a common sample size or sample completeness (sample coverages). This approach aims to compare gamma, alpha, and beta diversity estimates for equally-large (with a common sample size) or equally-complete (with a common sample coverage) samples; it is based on the seamless rarefaction and extrapolation (R/E) sampling curves of Hill numbers family.
